# Privacy Policy for Redshift Player

**Last Updated:** October 11, 2025

## Introduction

Redshift Player ("we", "our", or "the app") is a personal music player and library management application. This privacy policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the Redshift Player mobile application.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Redshift Player is designed with privacy as a core principle. **We do not collect, transmit, store, or process any personal information or user data.**

Specifically, we do not:

- Collect any personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Track your location
- Access your contacts, photos, or other personal data
- Collect analytics or usage statistics
- Use cookies or tracking technologies
- Share any information with third parties
- Store any data on external servers
- Require user accounts or authentication

## How the App Works

Redshift Player operates entirely locally on your device:

- **Music Files**: All music files you add to the app remain stored locally on your device. No files are uploaded to any server.
- **Metadata**: Song information (title, artist, album, etc.) is read from your music files and stored in a local database on your device only.
- **Playback Data**: Your playlists, favorites, and playback preferences are stored locally on your device and never leave it.
- **File Transfer**: When you transfer files to the app via iTunes File Sharing or other methods, these transfers occur directly between your computer and device without any intermediary servers.

## Data Storage

All data created or used by Redshift Player is stored exclusively in the app's local storage on your device. This includes:

- Music library database
- Playlist information
- User preferences and settings
- Playback history

This data is sandboxed within the app and is not accessible to other applications on your device (except through standard iOS sharing mechanisms that you explicitly control).

## Third-Party Services

Redshift Player does not integrate with or use any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or data processors.

## Children's Privacy

Redshift Player does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app is suitable for users of all ages (rated 4+).

## Your Responsibilities

While we do not collect any data, you are responsible for:

- Ensuring you have appropriate rights to any music files you add to the app
- Understanding that music files you add to the app are stored on your device
- Managing your device backups (which may include app data) according to your preferences

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Data Deletion

Since no data is collected or stored on our servers, you can delete all app data at any time by:

1. Deleting the app from your device, or
2. Using iOS Settings → General → iPhone Storage → Redshift Player → Delete App

This will permanently remove all locally stored data.

## Summary

**In plain English:** Redshift Player is a simple, private music player. We built it to manage your music files locally on your device. We don't collect any data about you, we don't track you, and we don't send any information anywhere. Your music and your data stay on your device, always.
