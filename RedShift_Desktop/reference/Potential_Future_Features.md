# Potential Future Features

## Album/Artist Browsing Views
**Status:** Deferred - Not high priority

**Current Approach:** Users can already:
- Use the three-column browser (Genre → Artist → Album) to filter tracks
- Play a full album by selecting it in the browser and clicking play on the first track
- This queues all tracks from that album for continuous playback

**Potential Enhancement:**
If implemented later, this would provide:
- Dedicated grid/list views for albums and artists with album art thumbnails
- Visual browsing interface (album art grids)
- One-click "Play All" buttons for albums/artists
- Drill-down views (Artist → Albums → Tracks)

**Rationale for Deferral:** The existing browser functionality already provides the core capability. This would be a UI enhancement rather than a functional requirement.
