REDSHIFT DEVELOPMENT PLAN - DOPPLER DESKTOP REPLACEMENT
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
Transform RedShift from a basic sync utility into a comprehensive music 
management and playback application that serves as the desktop counterpart 
to Doppler mobile app. This addresses the limitations of the official Doppler 
desktop app (lack of playlist sync, poor file tracking, etc.).

OBJECTIVES
================================================================================
✓ Maintain existing robust sync functionality
✓ Add full music playback capabilities (MP3, FLAC, M4A, etc.)
✓ Implement playlist management and syncing
✓ Create beautiful, modern music player interface
✓ Ensure cross-platform compatibility
✓ Enable non-sandboxed features for enhanced functionality

CURRENT CODEBASE ASSESSMENT
================================================================================
STRENGTHS:
✓ Solid Electron foundation with proper IPC communication
✓ SQLite database for sync tracking and file management
✓ File system monitoring with Chokidar for real-time updates
✓ Multiple transfer methods (libimobiledevice, pymobiledevice3, iTunes protocol)
✓ Clean separation of main/renderer processes
✓ Comprehensive sync logic with duplicate detection
✓ USB device monitoring for iPhone detection

AREAS FOR ENHANCEMENT:
- Basic UI designed as proof-of-concept
- No audio playback capabilities
- Limited library browsing functionality
- Missing playlist management
- No metadata extraction or album art display
